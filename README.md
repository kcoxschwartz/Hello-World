# Hello-World
I'm new to this software and am finding it interesting. While I have done web work, including writing my own html, I think this could be a great tool for collaborating with other team members on projects that need completing and editing. I just started a new job at Omaha Code School which is how I was introduced to github and a lot of other software I've never used before.
